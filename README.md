# Effective Visualizations for Multivariate NGS Data in R


Producing useful analyses and figures for both data exploration and explicit hypothesis testing can be a challenge.  Through the R environment, we can produce statistically sound statistics that are understood across multiple science fields.  

For the sake of this exercise we will focus on data generated as part of the lessons from the [NGS-2015 course regarding RNAseq in Drosophila](http://angus.readthedocs.org/en/2015/)
